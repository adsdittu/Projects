# Are Electric Vehicles the future?
This article throws light on what is an Electric Vehicle(EV), its components, their working, it's charging , and its range. It also compares it with Internal Combustion Engine(ICE) Vehicles.

An electric vehicle (EV) is an automobile that is powered by an Electric motor. It uses the energy stored in the batteries for moving the wheels forward. They have low running costs as electricity is one-tenth cheaper than the cost of Fossil fuels. Due to zero carbon emissions, low noise & high-efficiency EVs are a promising technology for achieving a sustainable future in the transport sector.

Let us now have a look at EV's main components

Using the electricity saved in the battery, EVs cycle the motor and generate the power necessary for driving. This is quite different from the working of Internal Combustion Engines(ICE), in which the engine exhausts fossil fuel to generate that power. EVs do not need engine and transmission for working like internal combustion vehicles. Instead, EVs carry several components for electric power: the motor, the battery, the onboard charger, and the Electric Power Control Unit(EPCU). All these components work together to convert the battery's electric energy to kinetic energy that drives the EV.

## Motor
The motor converts electric energy into kinetic energy that pushes the car forward. The advantage of using the motor over an engine is that the noise and the vibration associated with the car are minimized. While the EV is in acceleration, the motor drives the wheels. This same motor acts as a generator when the car is decelerating to convert kinetic energy into electric energy and saving it to the battery, thereby charging the battery. This is known as a "regenerative braking system." Some of the EVs are equipped with a mechanism that can control the levels of regenerative braking, thereby improving the fuel economy.

## Reducer
The reducer adjusts the number of motor revolutions and transmits them to the tires. This helps to effectively convey the motor's power to the wheel. The motor has a far higher RPM than that of an internal combustion engine(ICE), so the reducer must always reduce the RPM to an appropriate level. With the reduced RPM, the EV powertrain can take advantage of the resulting higher torque.

## Battery
The battery stores electrical energy and is similar to a fuel tank in an internal combustion engine(ICE). The range (maximum driving distance)of an EV is often determined by the battery capacity. By increasing the battery capacity one can achieve a longer range. However, a heavier battery takes away the boot space and worsens the energy efficiency and fuel economy. The best way to optimize the battery's performance is by maximizing the battery's energy density by having a small, lightweight battery that stores as much electric energy as possible.

## On-board Charger(OBC)
The On-board Charger(OBC) is used to convert Alternating Current(AC) into Direct Current(DC). The OBC is not needed in fast charging, since fast chargers already supply the electricity in Direct current(DC).

## Electric Power Control Unit(EPCU)
The Electric Power Control Unit(EPCU) is a combination of all devices that control the flow of the electric power in the vehicle.

## Charging
After the components, let us see how are EVs charged. There are two options â€“ charging your EV at home using your own domestic mains electricity supply or making use of public charging stations. The charging speed will depend on which particular EV you own, its battery capacity, and what sort of charging system you are using.

## Home charging

Around 80% of all EV charging is currently done at home. It requires the installation of a dedicated EV charging wall box. It is very convenient if you have a garage or driveway in which it can be positioned.

## AC HOUSEHOLD CHARGING WITH WALL BOX
- It takes around 6 to 8 hours to fully charge a 40 kWh battery car
- Provides charging through a 230V outlet

## Public charging stations
![ev_q7_sub_icon_01b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107342166/173234831-921760f2-2e7b-460b-a3dc-243698a6537e.jpg)

These are very convenient thanks to their widespread network throughout the urban areas. You can locate the nearest charging station using your phone's GPS. They allow you to top up your battery on the go if you need to travel longer distances.Most of the charging stations have a Cafe within the premises so that one can grab a bite while your EV is getting charged. Public charging offers AC Charging with a wall box or DC Fast Charging. Both options are quicker than charging at home.
- The quickest way to charge an electric vehicle at present
- It is capable of charging from 20 to 80% of charge in about 40 minutes
- Provides charging power above 50kW through a  450V outlet

## Range
The range is a significant criteri on while planning on buying an EV. The range of an EV depends on the number and type of batteries used, and (as with all vehicles), the aerodynamics, weight, type of vehicle, performance requirements, and the weather. Most electric cars are fitted with a display of the expected range. However, depending on the driving style and how the battery is powered, the estimate may vary from the actual range.

The following figure shows all the Electric Cars available in India along with the range they provide.

EVs are quite different from conventional vehicles with internal combustion engines(ICE). Right from the operating principle and basic mechanism to methods of usage and maintenance, the two categories differ in many aspects.

Comparisons between Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and Electric Vehicle(EV)

|**ICE** |**EV**|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Powertrain: IC engine | Powertrain : Motor |
| Emits greenhouse gases | No tailpipe emissions |
| Travels > 300 miles / fill | Travels < 100 miles / charge |
| Short refilling time (< 5 min.) | Long charging time (0.5-8 hr.) |
| Fuel tank takes less space | Battery takes large space |
| Higher maintenance costs | Lower maintenance costs |
| Running cost: high | Running cost: low |
| Noisy Operation | Quiet Operation |


There is a rise in demand for EVs over ICE-powered vehicles due to their numerous benefits like lower running costs, lower maintenance costs, and environment-friendly nature.
Following is a graph of the EVs market across the globe.

Many countries have stated that they will ban the sales of vehicles powered by fossil fuels(petrol and diesel)sometime in the future. The following figure is a pictorial representation of the same.

As seen above, EVs have many advantages compared to ICE-powered Vehicles. They are more environment friendly, have lower running costs, and lower maintenance costs. However, EVs too have limitations. The performance of an EV entirely depends on how much range the battery provides. If you are on a long road trip and have to stop every now and then to charge your EV for approx 40 min it can be annoying. You have to plan your trip and the stops that you will be taking around the charging stations. God forbid you are low on battery and get stuck in a traffic Jam or there's an emergency! So the future of EVs success totally depends on its battery. If researchers come up with a "super battery" that has a long-range and gets charged quickly future of EVs looks promising
