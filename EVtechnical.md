# Are Electric Vehicles the future?
This article throws light on what is an Electric Vehicle(EV), its components, their working, it's charging , and its range. It also compares it with Internal Combustion Engine(ICE) Vehicles.

An electric vehicle (EV) is an automobile that is powered by an Electric motor. It uses the energy stored in the batteries for moving the wheels forward. They have low running costs as electricity is one-tenth cheaper than the cost of Fossil fuels. Due to zero carbon emissions, low noise & high-efficiency EVs are a promising technology for achieving a sustainable future in the transport sector.

Let us now have a look at EV's main components

Using the electricity saved in the battery, EVs cycle the motor and generate the power necessary for driving. This is quite different from the working of Internal Combustion Engines(ICE), in which the engine exhausts fossil fuel to generate that power. EVs do not need engine and transmission for working like internal combustion vehicles. Instead, EVs carry several components for electric power: the motor, the battery, the onboard charger, and the Electric Power Control Unit(EPCU). All these components work together to convert the battery's electric energy to kinetic energy that drives the EV.


## Motor
The motor converts electric energy into kinetic energy that pushes the car forward. The advantage of using the motor over an engine is that the noise and the vibration associated with the car are minimized. While the EV is in acceleration, the motor drives the wheels. This same motor acts as a generator when the car is decelerating to convert kinetic energy into electric energy and saving it to the battery, thereby charging the battery. This is known as a "regenerative braking system." Some of the EVs are equipped with a mechanism that can control the levels of regenerative braking, thereby improving the fuel economy.


## Reducer
The reducer adjusts the number of motor revolutions and transmits them to the tires. This helps to effectively convey the motor's power to the wheel. The motor has a far higher RPM than that of an internal combustion engine(ICE), so the reducer must always reduce the RPM to an appropriate level. With the reduced RPM, the EV powertrain can take advantage of the resulting higher torque.


## Battery
The battery stores electrical energy and is similar to a fuel tank in an internal combustion engine(ICE). The range (maximum driving distance)of an EV is often determined by the battery capacity. By increasing the battery capacity one can achieve a longer range. However, a heavier battery takes away the boot space and worsens the energy efficiency and fuel economy. The best way to optimize the battery's performance is by maximizing the battery's energy density by having a small, lightweight battery that stores as much electric energy as possible.

## On-board Charger(OBC)
The On-board Charger(OBC) is used to convert Alternating Current(AC) into Direct Current(DC). The OBC is not needed in fast charging, since fast chargers already supply the electricity in Direct current(DC).
